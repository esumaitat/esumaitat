## Hello, World 🌍  

I’m **Sumaitat**, a junior **Electrical and Computer Engineering** student at **SUNY Albany** interested in building intelligent, data-driven systems that blend **signal processing**, **design**, and **AI**.  

### 🔬 What I’m Working On  
- Conducting **independent research** on *solar forecasting* with a university team — focusing on **EDA**, **data preprocessing**, and **model prototyping** for renewable energy prediction.  
- Participating in the **Break Through Tech AI program**, applying ML techniques to real-world social and economic data problems.  
- Developing **personal projects** in areas that excite me:  
  - 🎧 Audio signal processing  
  - 🎹 Sound synthesis and music tools  
  - Asteroid visualization and risk estimation* using NASA’s open data APIs  

As I continue expanding my programming and analytical skills, I’m exploring how **intelligent software** can eventually meet **efficient hardware** — from circuits to smart systems.

### 💡 Why I Build  
I’m drawn to projects that combine **creativity and computation** — systems that are not only intelligent but meaningful. Whether it’s improving how we hear, predict energy output, or understand data ethically, I want to make AI serve people and sustainability.
