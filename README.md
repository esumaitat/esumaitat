## Hello, World 🌍  

I’m **Sumaitat**, a junior **Electrical and Computer Engineering** student at **SUNY Albany** interested in building intelligent, data-driven systems that blend **signal processing**, **design**, and **AI**.  


<p align="center"> ⁎ ⁎ ⁎ </p>


### ⊹ What I’m Working On ⊹
- Conducting **independent research** on *solar forecasting* with a university team — focusing on **EDA**, **data preprocessing**, and **model prototyping** for renewable energy prediction.  
- Participating in the **Break Through Tech AI program**, applying ML techniques to real-world social and economic data problems.  
- Developing **personal projects** in areas that excite me:  
  - ☊ Audio signal processing  
  - 𝄫 Sound synthesis and music tools  
  - ✶ Asteroid visualization and risk estimation* using NASA’s open data APIs  

As I continue expanding my programming and analytical skills, I’m exploring how **intelligent software** can eventually meet **efficient hardware** — from circuits to smart systems.

###  ⊹ Why I Build  ⊹
I’m drawn to projects that merge **creativity and computation** — systems that are both intelligent and purposeful. Whether improving how we hear, predicting solar output, or interpreting complex data responsibly, I want to make AI practical, ethical, and **human-centered.**
